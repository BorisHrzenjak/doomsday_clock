# Doomsday Clock Project - Development Log

## 2025-03-01

### Clock Component Redesign
- Fixed the clock design by removing artifacts from the clock face
- Changed background to a solid dark color (#222)
- Removed "MIDNIGHT" text and hour markers
- Added proper clock numbers (12, 3, 6, 9) positioned correctly around the clock face
- Fixed TypeScript errors by creating a custom `clockPosition` prop that doesn't conflict with MUI's position type
- Used a proper type definition (`ClockPosition`) to ensure type safety
- Increased the clock size from 400px to 500px for better visibility
- Adjusted font size and element proportions to match the larger clock

### Layout Improvements
- Redesigned the layout to place the clock and risk indicator side by side on larger screens
- Implemented responsive design that stacks components vertically on smaller screens
- Added proper spacing and alignment between components
- Ensured the risk indicator remains visible and properly sized relative to the clock

### Doomsday-Themed Design Enhancements
- Added radiation symbol SVG components that pulse with animation
- Added warning tape with black and yellow stripes at the top and bottom of the page
- Enhanced background with subtle red pattern overlay
- Added decorative elements to the title including red gradient lines
- Enhanced the RiskIndicator component with:
  - Warning triangles with exclamation marks
  - Severity-based warning messages
  - Pulsing indicator lights that speed up based on risk level
  - Darker background with red border accent
- Added a footer with additional context about the Doomsday Clock
- Added decorative elements to section headers

### Technical Details
- Used Material-UI's styled components for styling
- Used Framer Motion for animations including:
  - Pulsing radiation symbols
  - Animated risk indicator
  - Staggered entrance animations for content
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for proper type checking
- Used shouldForwardProp to prevent prop conflicts with MUI components
- Added dynamic content that changes based on risk severity
- Implemented responsive layout using Material-UI's breakpoint system

### Deployment Fix (2025-03-01)
- Fixed NewsAPI 426 error in production environment
- Created a serverless API endpoint to proxy NewsAPI requests
- Added `/api/news.js` serverless function to handle API requests on the server side
- Updated `newsService.ts` to use different endpoints in development vs. production
- Added Vercel configuration file (`vercel.json`) to set up API routes and environment variables
- Updated README.md with detailed deployment instructions
- Added note about NewsAPI limitations in production environments

### Development Workflow Improvements (2025-03-01)
- Added `dev` script alias in package.json to support both `npm start` and `npm run dev` commands
- Updated documentation to clarify development server commands
